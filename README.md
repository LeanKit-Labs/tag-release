# `tag-release`

## Usage

### No Flags

You will be prompted for information regarding what type of update you are
making (major, minor, patch). Along the way, you'll have the opportunity to
verify, modify, or cancel the `tag-release` process.

```
$ tag-release

? What is your GitHub username
? What is your GitHub password
? What type of release is this (Use arrow keys)
❯ Major (Breaking Change)
  Minor (New Feature)
  Patch (Bug Fix)
etc...
```

### With Flags

```
$ tag-release --help
$ tag-release -h

Usage: tag-release [options]

Options:

  -h, --help            output usage information
  -r, --release [type]  Release type (major, minor, patch)
  --verbose             Console additional information
  -v                    Console the version of tag-release

Examples:

   $ tag-release
   $ tag-release --release major
   $ tag-release -r minor
   $ tag-release --verbose
   $ tag-release -v
```

### GitHub Integration

You will only be asked for your GitHub **username** and **password** when you first
start using `tag-release` (and also **authentication code** if you have 2FA
enabled). It will generate an authorization token with GitHub and store that in
your global git configuration for later usage.

```
# get the configs
git config --global tag-release.username
git config --global tag-release.token

# edit the configs
git config --global --edit

# unset the configs
git config --global --unset tag-release.username
git config --global --unset tag-release.token
```

Using the `--verbose` flag will output your `username` and `token`
information.

```
$ tag-release --verbose
--- GitHub Configuration ------------------------------------------------------
username             : johndoe
token                : a92282731316b2d4f2313ff64b1350b78a5d4cf6
