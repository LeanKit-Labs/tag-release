tag-release needs an upstream remote in order to work correctly. You can double check by running 'git remote -v'

To add a remote run 'git remote add upstream https://github.com/owner/repo.git'`,
	gitMergeUpstreamDefaultBranch: `It looks like git couldn't merge upstream default branch.

It could be that your local environment is out of sync with your upstream.

You might consider reseting your default branch by running 'git reset --hard upstream/defaultBranch'`,

You can easily create one by running 'npm init' and walking through the steps.`,
	"gitLog.log": `It looks like you don't have any commits to tag.`,

It could be that your local environment is out of sync with your upstream.
